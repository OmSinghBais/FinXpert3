## Alternative: Start Without These APIs

**Good News:** FinXpert works without these APIs!

- **For Development:** Use mock data (already implemented)
- **For Testing:** Use Supabase to store transaction data manually
- **For MVP:** Focus on Twilio, SendGrid, Setu first
- **Add Later:** Integrate BSE/NSE/Loan APIs when you have ARN and partnerships

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Month 1-2:** Get ARN, register with BSE/NSE
2. **Month 2-3:** Apply for ICICI Prudential partnership
3. **Month 3-4:** Contact loan partners
4. **Meanwhile:** Build and test FinXpert with mock data
